**Tilak Patel's portfolio. A résumé on the surface, and underneath it a universe you can fly through.**

A 3D map of the whole site with a starfighter to fly it, thirteen fan-made worlds to land on and walk (one of them a whole Star Wars galaxy), games, and online multiplayer. All of it runs on a static site.

## Hi, I'm Tilak

<img align="right" width="250" src="public/portrait.webp" alt="Tilak Patel smiling in a black rain jacket in front of a waterfall">

I plan technical programs and build the software behind them: capacity planning at AWS, a modernization roadmap at RTX, and engineering at Bose, Pendar, Empowerreg and SRC.

I study computer science at Northeastern University (B.S., graduating May 2027), and right now I'm a Technical Infrastructure Program Manager Intern at AWS, building data-center planning tools for generative-AI capacity. Off the clock: Game Boy emulators, open source, and an unreasonable amount of Star Wars. This site is where those meet.

**Open to technical program manager and software engineer roles.** [Say hello](mailto:tilakny@gmail.com).

The six pages are one feed: scroll to the end of any of them and the next begins under it, with a divider saying what comes next, and the address, the menu and the theme follow whichever page is on screen. After the sixth, an end card. Each page is still its own address, so every link works as before.

All of the content (roles, projects, skills, education) lives in [`src/data/`](src/data). Every page and the terminal read from there.

## The universe

<a href="https://tilakpatell.com/universe"><img src="docs/readme/home-system.webp" alt="The home system from above: a blazing sun inside a ring of asteroids, with the portfolio's six pages as small stations orbiting it, and a ringed gas giant beyond" width="100%"></a>

The front door (`/`) is a map of the whole site as places in space: the portfolio's pages are stations round a sun, and each fandom is a planet out in the dark. A first visit opens with a crawl, then puts you in a cockpit (the Millennium Falcon, an X-wing, Rick's space cruiser or Walt and Jesse's RV) and launches you into the map. Fly to a planet to open its page.

The places are a long way apart, and it feels it, the way the Star Wars galaxy does: from anywhere, the other worlds are only stars in the sky, white-hot and tinted their own colour, the nearer ones brighter, and a world turns into a planet only when you come near it. The big things read from anywhere: the Maw's burning disk, the Veil and the Cradle hanging huge in the dark, the big suns glaring. Names show where you look. Put the nose on a star and press `J` (or tap Jump), and the ship comes round onto it, spools up and jumps; or fly there yourself, at super speed or cruising. All of it under one sky, shared by every universe on the site and sharper on a strong machine.

The galaxy's star systems are on it too (the ship flies to the gate and on through), every place has a link that opens the map right there, and Tour takes you round everything in turn |
| `J` | Jump to the star your nose is on (its name shows with J), or else the place picked: the ship comes round onto it and goes. Each crew goes its own way: the X-wing and the Falcon to lightspeed, Rick's cruiser through a portal, Walt and Jesse's RV crystallising into Blue Sky and shattering out of it at the other end |

To go into a planet's world, fly down into its air: the glow round it. Come in at a normal speed and you're straight into the world itself (fly down into Bird World and you're with Birdperson), with no landing pad on the way. Come in boosting and it's a crash, and the crash takes you into the planet's world as it always has.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>The hangar and the shipyard</b></summary>

The hangar fits each ship out its own way, like a space sim's outfitting screen, and remembers it. Paint jobs are the site's own colour schemes: the six companies' come with the Cartographer achievement, and each fan scheme's with the easter egg that unlocks it. Parts bolt on and change how it flies and fights: strap-on boosters (solid rockets, an afterburner, repulsor pods, portal-fluid tanks), thrusters, twin or fusion guns, plating or fast-charge shields, and fins. Each draws power from the ship's plant and adds mass, so you can't fit the best of everything; the best parts are earned with achievements in the worlds. Other pilots see your paint and parts. The X-wing and the Falcon you fly are other people's models from Sketchfab (CC BY, credited on the map and in [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md)), brought to web size by `scripts/sketchfab-batch.mjs`; while they load, versions modelled in code (`universe/hulls.js`) stand in.

The hangar's first tab is the shipyard: fly the crew's own ship, or a garage build of your own, put together the way No Man's Sky puts its ships together. A build is a module for each slot (a hull: Dart, Saucer, Hauler or Needle; a cockpit; wings; engines; a tail; extras such as running lights or a turning radar dish) snapped onto the sockets its hull has for them, each one changing how it flies, and the hull its power plant. Roll picks a whole ship from a seed, the commoner modules more often; any slot can be picked by hand; a build's code (`GB-021301.k3`) passes it on. Builds are modelled in code (`universe/shipyard/`), take the paint jobs and the hangar's parts, fly in the galaxy and land on its worlds, and other pilots see them.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Other pilots, and what happens out there</b></summary>

Other pilots on the site at the same time show up in your sky. You can fly with them, fight hunters together, or shoot each other down. Off the map, in Middle-earth's towns and on its map, at Avengers HQ, in Albuquerque, on Dot Matrix island, in Dunder Mifflin's office, in the Smiths' street, on the Citadel's concourse and in the music courtyard, everyone else online shows up as a pale ghost from another world (a Frodo, a Spider-Man hologram, a Walt's Aztek, a Jim from another branch, a Morty or a Rick from another dimension, or in the courtyard a floating lamp) with their name over them; nothing passes between you but where each of you is.

The map is big: the planets are a hundred and more ship-lengths across, the fandoms far out in deep space, and between them the wonders: a ringed gas giant, an ice giant, two other suns with worlds of their own, a black hole, two nebulae, a pulsar, a binary star, a rogue planet with no sun and a wreck field round a white dwarf, with a rim of ice right round the edge of the map. Beside the Rick and Morty planet hangs a green portal: fly into it (or pick anywhere past it on the nav map, and the autopilot takes it on the way) and you come out in the Rick and Morty sector, a stretch of space of its own far past the rim, with the Citadel of Ricks at its heart, ten worlds from the show spread far apart round it (land on one and you're straight into it on foot as Morty; its own portal brings you back out to space), a green-tinged sun of its own, the Federation and the Gromflomites as its traffic and its hunters whoever you fly, and the Central Finite Curve glowing all the way round its edge. The Citadel's own portal takes you home.

Things happen while you fly. Hunters come after you (the Empire, the Galactic Federation, the Council of Ricks), a Star Destroyer drops out of hyperspace and launches its fighters (fight back: knock out its shield domes, then its bridge, before it runs, while its turbolasers fire on you), the aces change tactics when you hurt them (Fett drops seismic charges, Hank calls the DEA in), and the universe keeps score: shoot freighters and the ordinary ships run from you and the merchants shun you, cross the law and its patrols report you and every scan finds you wanted, save people and they call you a hero, someone calls for help with pirates on their tail, a convoy goes by, a comet crosses the sky, a star blows far out. A star flares and its shockwave rattles the ship. A rift tears open ahead of you: fly into it and it takes you somewhere else on the map. Something enormous swims past: a pod of purrgil, or a Cromulon with something to say. A stream of rocks crosses your path: shoot them, or steer round them. And now and then a bounty hunter comes for you alone: Boba Fett in Slave I, or Phoenixperson (shoot one down for the Wanted achievement). The crew have a word about all of it.

Space is busy, too. Ships come in to land on the planet you're at, shrinking down onto it, and others launch out of it; freighters, saucers and haulers curve round it on their way somewhere. A wing of fighters that's come past you peels apart behind you, each rolling away to its own side. When a fight starts the ordinary ships near you run for it, and convoys are longer, with an escort in the middle of the long ones.

And you're not always alone in a fight. When the hunters have been on you a while, or your shields are low, a wing of friends comes up from behind more often than not: X-wings for Luke and Han, Birdperson for Rick, either for Walt and Jesse. They cover you, going after the ones coming at you, a pass at a time, and peel away once the sky is clear.

Other people have fights too. Now and then, out ahead of you, a freighter is under attack: a Rebel transport with TIEs on it and two X-wings fighting them off, or a family saucer with the Galactic Federation on it and Birdperson in its defence. You see the flashes first. Fly in and help (the guns lock on to its attackers like any others), and if the freighter makes it, its crew thank you.

Every ship carries three guns, each in its crew's own terms: its blaster, a spread that throws a fan of five shorter shots, and heavy ordnance (the X-wing's proton torpedoes, the Falcon's concussion missiles, the cruiser's portal grenades, the RV's fulminated mercury), a slow round that homes on whatever the guns have locked and hits ten times as hard, from a rack of four that refills one at a time. Other pilots see which you're firing.

And the Citadel of Ricks can be brought down. A shield covers it while any of the four generators out on its arms' domes still runs; knock them all out with anything, then only heavy ordnance hurts the core, and the Council sends its hunters once you start. It goes up in fire and portal fluid and its wreckage drifts where it was, for everyone online, until the Ricks bring it back through a portal five minutes later (a siege nobody finishes is patched up four minutes after the last hit). The siege is shared without a server: each pilot speaks only for the damage they did, and every browser adds the shares up the same way (`universe/siege.js`).

In Rick's universe the Galactic Federation sometimes drops its NX-5 Planet Remover out of warp beside the planet you're at, its ring cannon charging. Shoot it down before it fires (anything hurts it), or watch the planet go dark and cracked for a minute, and nobody lands on it till it's back (`universe/remover.js`).

## A galaxy far, far away

<a href="https://tilakpatell.com/galaxy"><img src="docs/readme/galaxy-hero.webp" alt="The Millennium Falcon coming in over Mustafar, a black world veined with glowing lava" width="100%"></a>

Star Wars on the map isn't a planet but a universe of its own: the galaxy itself in miniature, a spiral of stars with its systems lit where they are, behind a hyperspace gate the Empire's Star Destroyers guard. Fly into the gate (or pick it and go) and you jump to lightspeed into `/galaxy`: eighteen star systems from the films (and from the two shows set after them, The Mandalorian and Ahsoka), from Tatooine, Hoth and Endor to Coruscant, Scarif, Nevarro and Mandalore, each with its region and grid square from the films' atlas, its era and films, and the moment it's remembered for playing out round it (Death Squadron over Hoth, the Battle of Endor, the Death Star rounding Yavin with its trench to fly, the Razor Crest with a TIE on its tail over Nevarro, the Mandalorians taking back Mandalore). Every pilot online sees the same moment at the same time, and meets the other pilots in the same system. Three of its worlds are whole places to walk: Coruscant (the Temple and its Archives, the Processional Way, the Senate, Dex's diner and the Outlander club, with the speeder chase and Order 66 to play), Yavin 4 (the Great Temple's hangar, war room and throne room, the briefing, the scramble and the medal ceremony) and Bespin (Cloud City's platforms and plaza, the dining room, the carbon-freezing chamber, the reactor gantry and the corridor out, with the freezing, the duel and Lobot's codes); their people go about their wants and say different things by who holds the world and what you've done, who holds a world meets you at its landing, and each has a ground battle of the war to fight for either side. Land anywhere and you're asked what to play, in Battlefront's own cards (Galactic Assault, Starfighter Assault, Heroes vs Villains, Blast, the world's story or free roam, with the ones still to come saying why), then deployed on a side, as a hero or one of the game's four trooper classes in that world's kit.

</table>

Every other system's star is up there in the sky, where it really is from where you are (Hoth's close by from Bespin, high above the galaxy's band; Coruscant's a bright star toward the core). Turn the nose toward one and its name comes up; put the nose on it and press `J` (or tap Jump), or just fly on out of the system toward it, and you jump.

Keep jumping and the Empire notices. Somewhere between your tenth and fifteenth jump an Imperial Interdictor cruiser is waiting on the lane: its gravity-well projectors pull you out of hyperspace a long way short of where you were going, its TIEs launch, and the hyperdrive won't take again (nor the sublight drive open up) until you're clear of the well: shoot its fighters down, run for the well's edge, or ride it out. Then it jumps away, and the count starts over.

And the galaxy is at war, three times over: the Clone Wars, the Galactic Civil War and the Remnant War after it, fought at once on the same map, Helldivers-style, by everyone online. Open the holotable, pick a war, and swear to a side of it: the Republic or the Separatists, the Rebellion or the Empire, the New Republic or the Imperial Remnant (your crew or your hero says which they'd pick). Each war's fronts move along the films' trade routes, both ways: the liberators push out from their worlds, the other side strikes back every few hours, and the Hutts hold Tatooine and Nevarro against everyone and raid whoever's next to them. Whoever holds a system decides what meets you there: their fleet in orbit, their fighters hunting you or flying escort, their troopers on the ground. Every system fights its own kind of battle (a siege at Endor, an evacuation at Hoth, an Interdictor to bring down at Mandalore, a blockade at Naboo, an ambush at Tatooine), with its commanders on the comms (Ackbar or Piett, Yoda or Grievous, Jabba for the Hutts) calling you by your rank, and what you do in it counts for your side for everyone. The war's three-day campaigns start over when they're done.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `J` | Jump to lightspeed, to the star your nose is on (every ten to fifteen jumps, an Interdictor pulls you out short) |
| `M` | The galaxy map: plot a course, filter by era or film |
| `E` | Land on the planet you're at (or board the Death Star) |

### Down on the worlds

Every planet from the films you can stand on (all but Alderaan, which is gone) is a world of its own to land on and walk: `/galaxy/tatooine/surface`. Your ship comes down out of the sky and sets down, and you and your crewmate climb out onto the sand, the snow, the forest floor, a platform over Bespin's clouds or a Coruscant rooftop. Each world has the places from the films to find (the Lars homestead, Mos Eisley and the Sarlacc on Tatooine; Echo Base on Hoth; the Ewok village and the shield-generator bunker on Endor…), named on a compass until you've found them, with what the crew have to say about each; its people and creatures going about their business, who'll talk if you go up to them; speeders, speeder bikes and tauntauns to ride; walkers, ships going over, the weather and the sound of the place. Online, the other pilots down on the same world are there with you. Get back in the ship to take off, back up to the system.

## The hidden worlds

Each planet on the map that has a world gets a page of its own, with its own art direction, soundboard and usually a game.

<summary><b>Everything in each world</b></summary>

| World | Route | Fandom | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A galaxy far, far away | [`/galaxy`](https://tilakpatell.com/galaxy) | Star Wars | Eighteen star systems to fly, jump between and fight over, each with a mission briefing, and the films' worlds to land on and walk |
| Death Star | [`/deathstar`](https://tilakpatell.com/deathstar) | Star Wars | Fly the trench run before Yavin 4 comes into range |
| Aboard the Death Star | [`/deathstar/inside`](https://tilakpatell.com/deathstar/inside) | Star Wars | Walk both Death Stars room by room, as a Rebel or an Imperial, in a story or free: Bay 327 and the Falcon, Docking Control, Detention Block AA-23 and cell 2187, the compactor, the tractor beam, the chasm, the overbridge with Alderaan through its window, Tarkin's conference room, the TIE bay; on the second station the dock, the command centre, Hangar 272 and the Emperor's throne room. The garrison works its consoles and walks its beats, doubts a Rebel in armour, sounds the alarm and fights; there are lightsabers, talk trees and Easter eggs (dial 3263827 on the compactor's hatch) |
| Music room | [`/music`](https://tilakpatell.com/music) | Indian classical music | Land on the music planet and walk a dusk courtyard in 3D to its instruments; a sitar with fret settings and an auto chikari, a real harmonium, the tabla and the tanpura; forty ragas, or your own. Everyone else online in the courtyard is a lamp floating where they stand, with their name over it |
| Middle-earth | [`/middle-earth`](https://tilakpatell.com/middle-earth) | The Lord of the Rings | A map of chapters: walk every stop on the road in 3D as Frodo, from Hobbiton to Mount Doom, each with a game on the side (Bilbo's spoons, a song on the Pony's table, Gandalf's mark, riddles with Bilbo, the plank over the well, Legolas's targets, ducks and drakes, Sméagol's safe way, crumbs on Sam's cloak, remembering the Shire); cook in co-op, Overcooked-style, in a kitchen at each one (Bilbo's party, the Prancing Pony, Weathertop, Elrond's table, the forges of Moria, Lórien's flets, Parth Galen, Ithilien, the orcs' mess in Cirith Ungol and the feast at Cormallen); open the Doors of Durin, cross Gorgoroth; find Orthanc off the road; and read the road so far on the map (seals, side stars, kitchen stars) |
| Cybertron | [`/cybertron`](https://tilakpatell.com/cybertron) | Transformers | Walk, drive and fight through Iacon at war as War for Cybertron's Optimus, in the Aligned continuity's own models (High Moon's games and *Prime*): transform into his truck any time on the ground (`Q`), hold the gates with Grimlock, run energon for Bumblebee, drive Jetfire's beacons to wake Metroplex, then defend the space-bridge pad from Megatron, who turns into his tank and charges, and take the Matrix of Leadership back from Shockwave in the Hall of Records. Barricade turns into his car and rams; Metroplex wakes on the skyline once you've woken him. Through the bridge are Team Prime's base (report to Ratchet, Bulkhead, Arcee and Bumblebee) and, through the ground bridge, the desert outside Jasper (clear the Decepticons' energon mine, find Arcee's Iacon relic). Mouse and keys, a gamepad, or touch sticks on a phone, where the world takes the whole screen. Below it: pick a side, write in Cybertronian, play *Roll out* |
| Avengers HQ | [`/avengers`](https://tilakpatell.com/avengers) | Marvel | Walk the compound in 3D as Spider-Man, or swing across it the way Insomniac's games do: hold the jump in the air to web a roof edge, a tree or a floodlight mast, steer the swing, let go on the upswing for a perfect release, zip with Shift, throw flips and twists in the air with `T` for style points that bank when you land (and are lost if you land mid-flip), run up any wall you hit and along the roofs, race the swing tour's rings round the compound (against a hologram of your best lap, once you have one), suit up in the Iron Man armour by Tony's workshop door (`E`) and fly it on its repulsors, stop time with `P` for a photo (the camera anywhere round him, a lens and a picture to save), and find the twelve backpacks Peter webbed up round it (on the roofs, up the masts, under the bridge), each with something of his in it. Everyone else online shows as a hologram. Each building opens its game (*Thwip!* at the front gate), and each game wins an Infinity Stone back for Thanos's gauntlet |
| Albuquerque | [`/albuquerque`](https://tilakpatell.com/albuquerque) | Breaking Bad | Drive around town in Walt's Aztek, which slides if you ask it to: `Space` is the handbrake (handbrake turns, drifts, a J-turn out of reverse), and `O` opens the driving settings (steering, stability, camera). Places open up as Walt's career grows, each with its own game. Other drivers online show up as ghost Azteks |
| Scranton | [`/scranton`](https://tilakpatell.com/scranton) | The Office | Walk Dunder Mifflin in 3D as Jim, from the lift to the annex, and get through a week in seven jobs (cover reception, the stapler in Jell-O, Kevin's chili, paper toss, Dwight's fact check, his fire drill, a Dundie from Michael); then the office from above, Dwight's fact check and the Dundies. Everyone else online walks the office as a pale Jim from another branch, with their name over him |
| Dimension C-137 | [`/c-137`](https://tilakpatell.com/c-137) | Rick and Morty | Walk the Smiths' street in 3D as Morty, fly Rick's cruiser (it talks, and the Federation's patrol ship flies alongside), meet the President at his limo and take his portal to the Oval Office, breakfast with a Federation agent at Shoney's, find Rick's clone lab under the garage and Morty's Mind Blowers past it, survive Total Rickall in the living room (find the parasites by their memories and spare Mr. Poopybutthole), meet the family's friends where the show has them (Mr. Poopybutthole on the couch, Snuffles on his bed, Space Beth at Rick's bench, Nancy and Tricia on Summer's bed, Diane as a hologram in the clone lab), sit through family therapy in Dr. Wong's office next door to Shoney's, see Space Beth's ship and Jerry's car-ship on the Smiths' lawn and the Gotron over the houses across the street, go through the garage portal to Blips and Chitz and play *Roy*, or dial the portal gun on Rick's bench (E there, or P or its button from anywhere in C-137) to send it to twenty-six more places from the show, each loaded only when it's dialled, and each with people who do something (they walk their rounds, turn to watch you, say a line as you pass, and some of them come for you: caught, you're back at the door): Interdimensional Customs (get Rick's Mega Seeds past the scanner, and run from the agents), Fantasy World, the Microverse, Anatomy Park, Needful Things, the Jerryboree, the Vindicators' ship (get through the rooms drunk Rick left them), the Zigerions' simulation (spot three slips in their copy of the street, then get out before they shut it down), the Story Train (find a ticket under a seat before the conductor reaches you), Rick Prime's fortress (reach his console past the drones' red eyes), Froopyland (reach Tommy past the Froopylanders), Mr. Nimbus's beach (approach the king past his Atlantean guard), the Gromflomite base (open Fart's cell without a guard seeing you), Heist-Con (take a badge and recruit Miles Knightly a crew), St. Gloopy Noops (visit Shrimply Pibbles), the Get Schwifty show (take the mic under the Cromulons, and dance), Evil Rick's lair (free three Mortys from his dome, then fight him: he hits, F fires, hearts in the HUD; beaten, he's down for good, and the Morty with the eyepatch tells you who was behind him before his yellow portal takes him), the Blood Dome (step into the ring and fight Hemorrhage), the Federation prison (throw the switches and unstrap Rick from the Brainalyzer past the guards), the cable studio (ten of interdimensional cable's people between takes: Ants in my Eyes Johnson, Baby Legs, Gazorpazorpfield and the rest, each with their lines), Mr. Goldenfold's dream (three things to find with Scary Terry on your heels, and a bed to hide under), the agency (take the key and spring Jaguar past the guards, with Pickle Rick on the desk, and a hole in the floor down to his sewer: a lane runner as the pickle, hopping grates and rats for the screws that make the rat-suit’s laser), the Meeseeks' golf course (press the box, then run), the vat of acid (jump in, lie still), Dimension 35-C (pick three Mega Seeds under the Federation's patrols) and Mr. Frundles' Earth (get Summer, Beth and Jerry to Rick's portal before the clock runs out, past the houses, the dog and the neighbours that have his face now); every figure and set piece is a model (Meshy, or found), never shapes, and the figures have clips of their own beyond idle, walk and run (Rick sips from his flask while he stands; Morty cheers, flinches, falls, cowers, fires and dances; Evil Rick punches, staggers and falls; Evil Morty sits with his arms crossed), made once on one Meshy skeleton and retargeted to each; the portal gun, *Portal panic*, the Meeseeks box and interdimensional cable; the wardrobe (C, or its button), to dress Morty and Rick as you like: Rick C-137, Tiny Rick or a Citadel Rick, Evil or Cop Morty, their coats, shirts, trousers and hair in the show's colours, a hat, shades or goggles, and the portal gun in hand, worn wherever they turn up (the street, the Citadel, the cruiser's seats, out of the ship on a planet) and seen online; and the Citadel of Ricks (`/c-137/citadel`, or fly into it on the map: it's at the heart of the Rick and Morty sector, reached through the green portal beside the Rick and Morty planet, with ten worlds from the show a thousand and more units apart round it: land on one (or G at its portal on the ground) and you're straight into its world on foot as Morty (`/c-137/<planet>`), each with something to do there, Gazorpazorp (keep clear of the men on the way to the women's gate), Planet Squanch (Birdperson's wedding, until the Federation crashes it), Bird World (Phoenixperson at Birdperson's door), Gear World (Gearhead at his shop), Pluto (tell the king it's a planet), Snake Planet (reach the snake rocket unbitten), Nuptia 4 (the couples' test, clear of the mythologs), the Immortality Field Resort (ride the Whirly Dirly), Cronenberg World (the Smiths who stayed, and the Cronenbergs who hunt) and the Purge Planet (pull the siren and outrun the villagers), and each with its own portal back out to space; and the Citadel's own portal back to the main map), walked in 3D as Rick C-137: a terrace over the show's city of Ricks, crowds of every Rick and Morty variant, a core of portal fluid with the Central Finite Curve turning round it, and five scenes from the show (Morty Day Care, Simple Rick's line, the Council, election day, the red alert); and down the lift in its south-west shopfronts, Mortytown, the Ricklantis Mixup's ghetto under the city: Morty Mart, The Creepy Morty with Big Morty on his stool at the door, Slick Morty, Rick D. Sanchez III and Simple Rick at the wafer factory's back door, Evil Rick walking the road, and the Mortytown Locos hiding down its alleys, to find and walk one by one to Cop Morty (the district and its people load only when you take the lift). Everyone else online walks the street as a Morty from another dimension, and the Citadel as a Rick |
| Earth | [`/earth`](https://tilakpatell.com/earth) | Travel | Down from orbit onto the globe as it is right now (NASA's Blue Marble and Black Marble, the real sun), then fly a little plane to every place I've been: a passport stamp and a postcard at each. Fly it from the chase camera or the cockpit (`V`), drag to look round it, get down under the cloud deck or up to the edge of space, barrel roll with `R`, and let the autopilot take it (it slows down to turn). A flight log keeps the trail flown and draws the route home to every place stamped; the distance adds up over every visit, and once round the world is an achievement. Everyone else online flying the Earth shows as a pale plane with their name |
| Dot Matrix | [`/dot-matrix`](https://tilakpatell.com/dot-matrix) | Gaming | A Game Boy island in its four greens (a Bayer-dithered last pass, outlines from the depth buffer): jump about, find the eight cartridges (each one a project) and play the giant Game Boy in the square, or the giant N64 beside it, which plays the Super Mario 64 tribute below, or the giant crafting table east of it, which opens the Minecraft tribute. Four villagers walk their beats and stop to talk, each with a hint to a cartridge; every fifteen coins give a heart back, and the last coin is an achievement; a lighthouse sweeps the islet and a windmill turns on the plateau; the wheel, a pinch or `+` `−` zoom the camera. Everyone else online on the island walks about as a ghost with their name over them. The page has the island's map, with the cartridges marked as they're found |
| Super Mario 64 | [`/dot-matrix/64`](https://tilakpatell.com/dot-matrix/64) | Super Mario | The giant N64 on Dot Matrix island plays the real game: a Nintendo 64 emulated in the browser (EmulatorJS's mupen64plus core) running the visitor's own ROM, a file from their device that stays in their browser (the site hosts no games), with keys laid out for Mario and controllers and touch working. Or a fan tribute to it: Peach's castle grounds and its inside to run about, with paintings that are the ways into its worlds, and star doors that open as Power Stars are found. Mario moves the way he did on the N64 (the triple jump, the backflip and side flip, the long jump, wall kicks, the dive, the ground pound, crouch slides, ledge grabs, swimming, picking things up and throwing them), with the three-distance camera behind him. Bob-omb Ridge is the first world: King Bob-omb on the summit, eight red coins, and the Chain Chomp to free, three stars of fifteen. Mario (rigged, and posed for every move), the cast and the props are fan-made Sketchfab models, none taken from a game; physically based CC0 textures, image-based light, soft shadows and bloom; the music is original and synthesised. Saves the stars, the lives and the look |
| Minecraft | [`/dot-matrix/minecraft`](https://tilakpatell.com/dot-matrix/minecraft) | Minecraft | The giant crafting table on Dot Matrix island opens the game itself behind a password: Eaglercraft 1.12.2 and 1.8.8 (the real client compiled to JavaScript), its files sealed with the password (AES-GCM from PBKDF2) and opened in the browser, worlds saved on the visitor's device, shared worlds to import, Open to LAN through Eaglercraft's relays. Without the password, a fan tribute: an endless world of one-metre blocks made from a seed in 16 × 16 × 256 chunks (hills, forests of oak, birch and spruce, deserts, snow, beaches and the sea at 63), generated and meshed in a worker with the game's corner shading, drawn with the game's flat light and fog. The player walks, sprints, sneaks, jumps and swims by the game's own numbers at 20 ticks a second. The textures are the game's own (1.21.11), used with Mojang's permission; digging, building, the night, caves and mobs come in phases |
| The Caribbean | [`/caribbean`](https://tilakpatell.com/caribbean) | Pirates of the Caribbean | Sail *Dead Man's Tide* at the Black Pearl's helm |
| Invincible | [`/invincible`](https://tilakpatell.com/invincible) | Invincible | Fly the Graysons' whole city in 3D as Mark: six kilometres of downtown, river, suburbs and coast, through the sound barrier, into the ground hard enough to crack it, and up out of the air into space, to the Moon and Mars. Dad's rings, eight hidden title cards, rescues, traffic and people, Atom Eve on patrol, Allen and Thragg out in space; a season of seven episodes from Cecil's board and Dad (the Mauler twins at the bank, Doc Seismic at the school, the Flaxans, the hangar siege, the Moon) with the radio's chases, photos and Eve's race between them; then *Think, Mark!* below it, with HD figures |

## Easter eggs

- **↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A** jumps to lightspeed.
- **⌘K / Ctrl+K** opens a command palette that can go anywhere on the site and run its tricks.
- There are dozens of achievements to unlock. Scranton's Dundies hand them out as awards.
- The fan colour schemes the eggs unlock each bring a live background to the portfolio pages: a dogfight crossing the stars for the Jedi and the Sith, Heisenberg's blue crystals, Iron Man's HUD tracking the pointer, Dunder Mifflin's paper and paper airplanes, invaders marching over a synthwave grid, diyas and sky lanterns, a ship on the horizon at Tortuga, Cybertron's energon and insignia, the Shire's fireworks or the Eye of Sauron watching you, and portals. Click on empty page for a surprise. The company schemes get quieter ones drawn from the work (AWS's racks and smile, RTX's engineering drawing, Bose's sound, Pendar's spectra, Empowerreg's knowledge graph, SRC's radar), and each project's page gets one of its own (the Game Boy's dot matrix, Claude's spark, DevSpace's minimap, GitHub's contribution graph, the shell's prompt, FUSE's file tree, the finance platform's candles, PyTorch's network, a GPU die).

And to [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com) and [ambientCG](https://ambientcg.com) for their free scans and skies, [Kenney](https://kenney.nl) for the kits behind *Portal panic*, NASA Earth Observatory for the Blue Marble and Black Marble, Natural Earth, the photographers on Wikimedia Commons, the type designers behind every open font here, and the people who make [three.js](https://threejs.org).

**The light in the worlds is [Bruno Simon](https://bruno-simon.com)'s idea**, from his folio ([`brunosimon/folio-2019`](https://github.com/brunosimon/folio-2019), MIT): the light lives in textures, not in a shadow pass. As each world opens, it renders its floor's soft shadows and the sky's occlusion once, on the GPU, and warms the lower faces of everything with the ground's colour. Whatever moves stands on a soft blob slid away from the sun (`src/lib/three/groundwork.js`; the research is [`docs/research/2026-10-06-bruno-simon-folio.md`](docs/research/2026-10-06-bruno-simon-folio.md)).

> **Did you make something that's on this site, and I've missed you or got it wrong?** Message me at [tilakny@gmail.com](mailto:tilakny@gmail.com) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tilakpatell) and I'll add you straight away, or open a pull request. If you'd rather your work came down, say so and it will.

The characters and buildings in the worlds that aren't anyone else's were made for this site with [Meshy](https://www.meshy.ai), or modelled in code. CREDITS.md is made by `npm run credits` from the same lists the site reads, so it stays in step with them.

## Under the hood

### Tech stack

- **[React 19](https://react.dev/)** with [React Router 7](https://reactrouter.com/) (hash routing, so it works on static hosting)
- **[Vite 8](https://vitejs.dev/)** (Rolldown) for the dev server and build
- **[Tailwind CSS 3](https://tailwindcss.com/)** plus per-company and per-world themes
- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)** for every 3D scene and game, loaded only when needed
- **[Nostr](https://nostr.com/)** public relays for multiplayer, with events signed using [`@noble/secp256k1`](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-secp256k1). There's no backend.
- **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)** for tests and **ESLint** for linting
- **GitHub Actions** and **GitHub Pages** for deploys

### Running it

You need **Node.js 22** (the version CI uses) and npm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tilakpatell/new-portfolio-website.git tilakpatell.com
cd tilakpatell.com
npm install
npm run dev
```

The site is then running at http://localhost:5173.

To try a lower graphics tier on a desktop, add `?quality=low` (or `mid` or `high`) to the address.

### Scripts

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the Vite dev server |
| `npm run build` | Production build into `dist/`. Takes a fresh GitHub snapshot first (`prebuild`) |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `npm test` | Run the Vitest suite (game rules, flight model, multiplayer protocol and more) |
| `npm run credits` | Rebuild [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) from the site's own credit lists |
| `node scripts/autopilot-check.mjs` | Everything the autopilot checks before a merge: lint, tests, build, bundle sizes, every page in headless Chromium |

The asset pipeline scripts regenerate committed files. You don't need them to run the site.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run cc0` | Fetch the games' CC0 scans and skies from Poly Haven and ambientCG into `public/games/` (behind a proxy, set `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1`) |
| `npm run hq-assets` | Fetch and shrink the Avengers HQ games' CC0 assets into `public/hq/` |
| `npm run kenney` | Convert Kenney's kits for *Portal panic* (`KENNEY=/path/to/kits npm run kenney`) |
| `node scripts/kit/import.mjs <pack> [family …] [--from <dir>]` | A Quaternius pack (fetched into `lab/assets/` by `node scripts/assets-fetch.mjs <pack>`) as the worlds' kit: one GLB a family (more for a heavy one), each model with its LOD1, and a manifest of what each is, into `public/kit/<pack>/`. The manual and the budgets: [scripts/kit/README.md](scripts/kit/README.md) |
| `node scripts/kit/fbx.mjs <pack>` | A Quaternius pack that comes as FBX only (the farm animals, the street and furniture packs) as GLBs in metres, clips named by their action, into `lab/assets/<pack>-glb/` for `scripts/kit/import.mjs` to read (through the dev server on 5188, started if it's down) |
| `node scripts/kit-check.mjs` | Every kit pack in `public/kit/` against its manifest: the licence and source said, each model's file there, files, trees and LOD1s within the budgets in `scripts/kit/manifest.mjs`, no GLB that no model is in. Prints each pack's size in MiB; exit 1 on anything wrong |
| `node scripts/kit-shot.mjs [out dir] [pack] [scatter <Name>:<n>,…] [pools <Name>,…] [far <Name>:<n>]` | Kit models as the worlds draw them: the galaxy placer's `kit:` rows and the kit's pools, with `far`'s model (`Birch_1:2` for naturemega, none for another pack) in its puff band, as `scatter.png` and `pools.png` in `lab/kit/` (or the out dir), failing on any shader, page or console error, or a `far` that drew no puff (through the dev server on port 5188) |
| `npm run photos` | Turn the Travel photos into small WebP files and record their sizes, alt text and credits |
| `npm run globe` | Rebuild the dotted globe on the Travel page |
| `python3 scripts/build-harmonium.py` | Rebuild the music room's harmonium from its CC0 recording (downloads it the first time) |
| `node scripts/meshy-community.mjs search [name … \| mine \| phase1 … phase6]` | Look through Meshy's community for the Rick and Morty multiverse's figures and vehicles before paying to make them: candidates and a numbered contact sheet per asset in `lab/meshy/community/` (no key needed). `import <name> <file>` brings a hand-downloaded prop into `public/models/c137/rm/` with its credit |
| `node scripts/rm-cast-shot.mjs <prefix> name:height,… [clips] [views] --fit` | Rick and Morty's Meshy figures beside Rick through the games' own cast loader, held on a frame of each clip, for judging a rig (through the dev server on port 5197) |
| `OUT=<dir> node scripts/c137-shots.mjs [name …]` | Dimension C-137 as Morty sees it, one PNG a view (the garage, the living room, Total Rickall, Summer’s room, the clone lab, Dr. Wong’s office, the street by the house, the lawn’s ships, the Gotron, the portal gun, each place it dials, and the ten planets of the Rick and Morty sector): the world’s dev hook takes him there as a door would, and each shot waits till everything there has loaded (through the dev server on port 5197) |
| `node scripts/ktx2.mjs report <files>` | For each texture in the given GLBs or images: what it would cost and save as a GPU-compressed KTX2 (bytes, GPU memory, PSNR) and whether it's worth it. `convert` rewrites them; the site's loader reads KTX2 already |
| `OUT=<dir> node scripts/citadel-shots.mjs [name …]` | The Citadel and Mortytown as Rick sees them, one PNG a view (the lift on the concourse, Mortytown's street, The Creepy Morty, Morty Mart, the factory's back door, an alley, the hunt): the world's dev hook takes the lift down and puts him there (through the dev server on port 5197; `INFO=1` prints the renderer's counts) |
| `node scripts/model-scout.mjs <name> "<query>" [--rigged]` | Before Meshy makes anything, looks for it already made: searches Sketchfab for downloadable CC0 and Attribution models (never “no derivatives”) and writes the best, with their thumbnails, to `lab/meshy/scout/<name>/` to be judged against the wiki’s reference sheet. `fetch <name> <uid> <out.glb>` brings in the one that passes at web size and credits it |
| `node scripts/wiki-refs.mjs <wiki titles>` | Fetch each Rick and Morty wiki page’s infobox image and Appearance section (else its intro) into `lab/meshy/refs/<name>/`: the reference sheet a model, from Sketchfab or Meshy, is judged against |

The scripts that call Meshy (`scripts/meshy*.mjs`) read `MESHY_API_KEY` from `.env.local`; `scripts/meshy.mjs <step> hd` makes Rick and Morty again at about 40,000 faces and 2k textures from their own concept images. Sketchfab downloads are brought down to web size by `scripts/sketchfab-import.mjs` and `scripts/sketchfab-batch.mjs`; the wardrobe's portal gun by `scripts/sketchfab-gear.mjs`.

### How it works

A few of the design decisions behind the site:

- **Content is data.** Pages render from `src/data/`, so updating a role or project is a one-file change.
- **3D first, with fallbacks.** Scenes render in WebGL wherever it's available, lower their own resolution and effects when frames run late, and fall back to SVG or 2D only when WebGL isn't there at all. Shaders compile in the background before the first frame, so a scene scrolling into view doesn't stall the page.
- **Every device gets a budget.** `src/lib/device.js` sorts each device into a `high`, `mid` or `low` tier once, and every renderer starts from that tier's pixel ratio, antialiasing, shadows and bloom. On phones, heavy worlds ask before downloading anything.
- **One runtime for the worlds.** The full-screen worlds plug into one world runtime (`src/runtime/`): one renderer (WebGPU where the browser has it and a world's shaders allow, WebGL otherwise), one frame loop, one input reader, one audio bus, one save store, one asset cache and one quality controller. A world is a module; two modules can hand over to each other without a cut. Earth is on it; the rest follow one at a time ([the design](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-06-world-runtime-design.md)).
- **Game logic is plain, tested code.** The games keep their rules in a `rules.js` that's separate from the rendering and covered by Vitest. The same goes for the starfighter's flight model and targeting.
- **Multiplayer without a server.** Pilots meet in a room on public Nostr relays over ordinary WebSockets. Every event is signed with a per-visit key and checked on arrival, and signing happens in a Web Worker so it stays off the render loop. Pilots never see each other's IP addresses. Each walkable world is a room of its own, joined with the same key, so the ghost walking your town is the person in the roster, a block holds everywhere, and the roster names the exact world or town each person is in.
- **No runtime calls to asset services.** Every model and texture is generated or downloaded ahead of time and committed, so the deployed site only ever loads its own files.

For the details of each subsystem, see [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

### Deployment

Every push to `main` triggers [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml). It installs dependencies with `npm ci`, then lints, runs the tests and builds, and deploys `dist/` to GitHub Pages at the custom domain in `public/CNAME`. A failing lint or test stops the deploy.

The site's routes are hash routes (`/#/projects/x`), and what follows the `#` never reaches a server, so every build also writes a page of its own for each route (`dist/projects/x/index.html`: `scripts/prerender.mjs`) with that page's title, description, preview card and canonical address, and a first line that moves the visitor onto the app's own address. A link like `tilakpatell.com/projects/gameboy-emulator` shows its own card wherever it's shared, and `sitemap.xml` lists them all.

A deploy replaces every file in `/assets` (they're named by hash), so a page that's already open, or an `index.html` a cache still holds, can ask for files that are gone; behind the intro, that used to surface only at the cut to the universe, as "This page didn't load". A page that hits one reloads from the new build (`src/lib/stale.js`, through `ErrorBoundary`), past any cached `index.html`, playing the intro again if it was partway through; it won't reload twice within a minute, so an outage can't loop.

> **Working with Claude Code?** Agent skills live in `.claude/skills` (their sources are pinned in `skills-lock.json`). Lint and tests skip them.

### The autopilot

The site improves itself. A scheduled Claude Code session comes round (every four hours), makes one improvement well (something faster or better-looking more often than something new), checks it with `node scripts/autopilot-check.mjs` (lint, the tests, the build, every page in a headless browser), opens a pull request, waits for CI, merges it, and logs it on [`/changes`](https://tilakpatell.com/changes), the ship's log, with a screenshot. Any change there can be taken out again by telling a Claude session `Revert change 12`. The protocol is [`.claude/skills/autopilot/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/autopilot/SKILL.md), the queue is [`docs/autopilot/backlog.md`](docs/autopilot/backlog.md), and the switches (pause, runs a day, the plan's limit) are in [`docs/autopilot/budget.json`](docs/autopilot/budget.json). [`docs/autopilot/README.md`](docs/autopilot/README.md) has the details.
