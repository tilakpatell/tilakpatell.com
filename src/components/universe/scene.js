// The universe map in WebGL: the planets on a tilted disc among the stars,
// a faint orbit for each, and the planets' names as DOM buttons that React
// renders once and the scene moves as it draws (nothing re-renders per
// frame).
//
// Two ways to get round it:
// - With no ship picked, the camera flies between the planets (flight.js
//   does the numbers), a drag turns the map and a click picks a planet.
// - With a ship (Rick's cruiser, Luke's X-wing, the Falcon or Walt and
//   Jesse's RV), you fly it, Battlefront's way, free all the way round (it
//   loops, rolls and flies upside down): W and S for the throttle, A and D
//   to roll, the arrows to swing the nose left and right and pull it up and
//   down, Space to boost, F (held) to fire, T (Shift+T back) to switch
//   target, or drag on the map like a stick (a mouse swings the nose, a
//   finger turns it and works the throttle, with buttons to pull the nose up
//   and down). Let go and it rolls itself back upright. How quick each of
//   those is, and more (A and D can turn instead), is the visitor's to set
//   (controls.js, FlightSettings.jsx). The camera rides behind it, rolling
//   with it and swinging round after it, or, with V, you sit in the cockpit
//   (the intro's, cockpit/vehicles, drawn over the world from the pilot's
//   seat; the choice is kept between visits).
//   Fly close to a planet and you're at it (the panel shows its card); pick
//   one from its name or by clicking it and the ship flies itself there,
//   by the drive picked on the nav map (M, or the map button: NavMap.jsx,
//   nav.js): a jump to lightspeed that brings it out parked there
//   (hyperspeed, J for the place picked), or the autopilot on super speed
//   (the pulse drive pushed past itself) or cruising. The nav map can pull
//   back to the whole map in 3D, too. ship.js has the physics. A new ship starts
//   anywhere, unless a place is picked: at the edge of the home system, or
//   out in deep space off a fandom's planet or a wonder (ship.js's startAt),
//   so pilots joining don't all turn up in one spot.
//   Out past the home system is deep space (deep.js, deepspace.js), vast:
//   the fandoms' planets are far out in it, hundreds of units apart, each
//   marked by a beacon (beacons.js) so it reads as somewhere to go, with
//   wonders between them, all reached on the pulse drive (click a wonder
//   and the ship takes you: ship.js's autopilot). You're not alone: traffic
//   (traffic.js), hunters after you (hunters.js, flown by hunterRules.js:
//   the Empire, the Federation, the Council of Ricks, more of them the more
//   trouble you make and nobody new while your shields are low; they steer
//   round the planets, which are cover; a pack that drops in ahead of you on
//   the way somewhere interdicts you: the pulse drive is cut to the boost
//   while they're on you, 40 s at most), with shields that take their hits
//   and come back, and now and then the director (director.js) sets
//   something going (setpieces.js: a Star Destroyer jumping in, portals, a
//   comet; a convoy, someone in distress; a supernova, far off). The guns
//   lock on to a hunter ahead (targeting.js) and a HUD over the canvas
//   (UniverseMap.jsx) shows the gun line, the lock, the lead to shoot at
//   and the way to wherever you're going. Fly into a wonder too fast and
//   it's a crash of its own kind: the Citadel takes you on into its world,
//   a star burns you back, a giant takes you down into its clouds. The
//   black hole, the Maw, pulls you in as you come near it, and past its
//   point of no return (maw.js) you watch your ship spiral down it from a
//   way off, then go in after it (infall.js draws the fall), and the page
//   goes on to what's beyond.
//   The ship is fitted out in the hangar (outfit.js): a paint job on its
//   hull, glow and shots (livery.js), and parts bolted on (modules.js) that
//   change how it flies (ship.js's tune: boosters push the boost, thrusters
//   turn it quicker, mass slows it), how its guns fire (faster, or harder
//   on a hunter, from barrels of their own) and what its shields take; its
//   boosters burn exhausts of their own as it boosts. The autopilot flies
//   it as it came, so it still stops where it means to.
//   Gone online (online/), the other visitors flying it are here too
//   (online/pilots.js): their ships and callsigns, and their shots; the guns
//   lock on to anyone who isn't your ally (nor just back from being shot
//   down), a hit comes off their shields (they're told, and take it
//   themselves), and theirs off yours. The hunters after each pilot are in
//   everyone's sky: yours go out to the others (net.pack), theirs are
//   drawn here and can be shot at, the hit told to whoever they're after.
//
// A scene module for lib/three/useScene: create(canvas, ctx) returns
// { resize, render, update, setVisible, lowerQuality, hover, dive, escape,
//   whole, boost, climb, fire, dispose }.
// Props: selected (an id or null), ship (a crew id or null), loadout (what's
// fitted to it in the hangar: outfit.js's paint job and parts, which it
// wears and flies on), controls (the
// visitor's flying settings: controls.js), labels (a ref
// to { id: element }), stick (a ref to the steering ring), alt (a ref to the
// height gauge), shield (a ref to the shields bar), hud (a ref to the
// targeting HUD's box: the reticle, the lock, the lead and the nav bracket
// are its children), net (online/client.js's link to the other pilots, or
// null), tags (a ref to the box their callsigns go in), frozen (the page
// is leaving: stop drawing), onPick(id), onOpen(id) (a station's sign was
// clicked: go to its page), onEvent(event), onLand(), onCrash(id, page) (the ship
// went into a planet or a station too fast and the impact has played, or
// fell into the black hole and is gone: true if the page goes on into its
// page, or on through to what's beyond the hole, so the ship doesn't come back;
// `page`, where a wonder with a page of its own goes instead).
