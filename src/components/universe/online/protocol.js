// Multiplayer on the universe map, as plain rules: what goes over the wire
// between pilots and how anything that comes in is read. Pure (no three.js,
// no network), so it's tested in Node; client.js does the talking (through
// nostr.js's relays) and pilots.js draws everyone else.
//
// Everything a peer sends is untrusted: a name is cleaned before it's shown
// (and only ever set as text), numbers are checked and clamped, each pilot
// may send only so much of each kind of message (createLimiter: past that
// it's dropped, and a flood gets them muted), and a hit is believed only
// from someone who isn't an ally (or a squadmate), fired a shot that would have passed near
// you a moment ago (aimedAt), was close enough, and isn't hitting faster
// than the guns fire; a ram only from someone who isn't an ally and was last
// seen touching you, as hard as both your speeds allow (ramCounts). The
// hunters after a pilot are theirs to fly: what they
// say of them is only drawn, and a hit on one of yours by someone else is
// believed only from a pilot who's here, has just fired and is close to it
// (any pilot here can still clear your hunters for you: that's the point).
