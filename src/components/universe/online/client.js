// The multiplayer link: everyone on the site who's gone online, in one
// room (nostr.js: public Nostr relays carry everything, so it works from
// any network, and no pilot sees another's IP address; the site is static,
// so there's no server of its own). It keeps who's here (their callsign,
// ship and what's fitted to it, kills, which page they're on, and whether you're
// allies), where each was last seen on the universe map, the shots they
// fire there, and their pointer on any other page, and sends yours. The scene (scene.js, pilots.js) reads poses and shots from it each
// frame, Presence.jsx the pointers; the page (useOnline.js, Online.jsx)
// shows the roster and what's happening. protocol.js has the wire and the
// rules for what's believed.
//
// Defences, since anyone can join with a client of their own: each pilot
// may send only so much of each kind of message (a flood gets them muted
// for the visit), hits must come from a shot aimed your way, kills are
// counted from what this browser saw (a shot or a hit just before, close
// by), not from what a pilot says of themselves, an alliance turned down
// can't be asked for again straight away, and anyone who goes quiet is
// dropped. A heartbeat keeps you on everyone's list while you sit still.
//
// Allies and blocks last (`allies`, allies.js's store, kept by the other
// pilot's key): a saved ally's first hello is answered with an ask that says
// you know them ({ t: 'ask', k: 1 }), and such an ask from a pilot you've
// saved is a yes without a word to you, so two allies are allies again a
// moment after both are online (and nobody's paid for it again: 'allied' is
// for an alliance newly made). Only an alliance made with the key you fly
// now is asked for like that (a guest tab's key, or a new identity, is one
// they don't know: those are asked for by hand). An alliance made is saved
// with the key you flew; a no or an end,
// theirs or yours, forgets it. A saved block holds from a pilot's first
// word (their row is listed, blocked, to be unblocked); a block or an
// unblock of yours is saved (and a block ends an alliance), while a flood's
// mute is for the visit: nothing's saved, no alliance ends, they're told
// nothing.
//
// Your squadmates (setSquad: squad/squad.js's members) are allies for
// everything the game asks: your hits aren't sent at them, theirs don't count
// with you. An invite to a squad goes to one pilot (inv, wire2.js), yours no
// faster than the others take them; theirs is told to you once (the same
// squad again within INVITE_AGAIN_MS isn't), and one you've turned down
// (declineInvite) holds them off as long.
//
// Everyone's chat is said here too (say, qc: wire2.js), only while the
// owner's switch is on (chat/text.js's CHAT.everyone), each line cleaned
// again as it comes in; a line for here, or a quick-chat phrase, is told
// only from someone in the same place. The blocked aren't heard, nor anyone
// muted for a flood; chat.js's Mute is the page's, for words alone.
//
// The hunters after you are yours to fly (hunters.js), and the others see
// them: while someone's in the same place, where they are goes out a few
// times a second (pack), each pilot's come in as peer.hunters ({ at, list })
// for pilots.js to draw, and a bolt of someone else's into one of yours is
// told to you (hunterHit → a 'hunterHit' event, once it's checked: they'd
// just fired, and were close to it), so a friend can shoot one off your tail.
