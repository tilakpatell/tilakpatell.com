// A galaxy far, far away, in WebGL: one star system at a time (world.js
// builds it: its planet, its moons, the moment from the films it's
// remembered for), under its own sky (sky.js: the galaxy seen from where the
// system is in it), flown in the ship you fly the universe map in, the same
// way (universe/ship.js, free all the way round, Battlefront's controls,
// universe/controls.js's settings): W and S the throttle, A and D the roll,
// the arrows the nose, Space to boost (out in the open, the sublight drive
// opens up: space.js), F to fire, T and Q to change target, V the cockpit,
// a drag on the map like a stick, G the crew's power and X the big one once
// it's charged (powers.js: Force Focus and a torpedo salvo for Luke, the
// corkscrew and Chewie on the guns for Han, the portal gun and the death ray
// for Rick, the magnet and the crystal for Walt and Jesse). The HUD over it is the universe map's: the
// gun line, the lock and the lead, the threats you can't see, the way to
// wherever you're going (the page's markup, UniverseMap.jsx's classes).
//
// Between systems you jump. Every other system's star is in the sky where
// it really is from here (sky.js, systems.js courseTo), named as the nose
// comes near it: point at one and press J (or the Jump button), or fly out
// of the system with the nose on one, and you're away; or plot a course on
// the galaxy map (the page's) and the ship comes round onto it. It spools
// up and you're in hyperspace: the site's own jump, the same as the universe
// map's (components/Hyperspace.jsx, which the page plays over the scene),
// held in its tunnel while the next system's built behind it; then you drop
// out at its planet, on the side you came in from. The page follows the
// system you're in (/galaxy/hoth), and a link to another sends you jumping
// there.
//
// The Galactic Civil War (gcw.js) is on: at a system it's being fought over,
// its battle's there as you drop in (warfront.js: battles.js lays it out at
// the planet, universe/battle.js fights it), and you're in it, on the
// Rebellion's side; what you do there counts in the war, shared online.
//
// Out there: hunters by who holds the system (galaxy/hunted.js through
// universe/hunters.js), now and then a Star Destroyer dropping out of
// hyperspace to launch its TIEs at you (universe/setpieces.js), traffic
// going about its business, and online (universe/online/), the other pilots
// in the same system, in their own ships: allies, or fair game. Crash into
// the planet too fast and you come back out of hyperspace off it; fly into
// the Death Star and you're aboard (the page goes to it); stray into its
// tractor beam at Alderaan and it pulls you in.
//
// Keep jumping and the Empire counts (interdiction.js): the tenth to
// fifteenth jump of a cycle is cut short, an Interdictor cruiser
// (interdictor.js) dropping in across the bow where you fall out, a long
// way short of the planet, its TIEs launching and its gravity well holding
// the hyperdrive (and the sublight drive) down till you're clear of it: its
// fighters gone, out past the well, or a minute ridden out.
//
// A scene module, a world on the world runtime through ./module.js
// (src/runtime's fromScene): create(canvas, ctx) draws with the runtime's
// renderer (ctx.rt.gfx: the runtime sizes it and sets its sharpness) and
// returns { ready, resize, render, update, setVisible, lowerQuality, fire,
// boost, climb, seat, power, escape, jump, goTo, flyTo, dispose }.
// Props: system (an id), ship (a crew id), loadout (what's fitted to it in
// the universe map's hangar: outfit.js; its paint and parts, and how they
// make it fly), controls, net, stick,
// shield, hud, powers (the power bar: PowerBar.jsx), tags, labels (refs, as the universe map's), stars (a ref:
// the other systems' names, by id, moved over their stars), frozen,
// onArrive(id, from) (a jump's come out at a system), onAt(goal id or null),
// onBoard(path) (into the Death Star), onCrash(systemId) → bool (into the
// planet: the page takes you down to its surface, or says no), onEvent(e) (for the comms and the
// page; { type: 'aim', id } as the nose comes onto a star or off it; and
// { type: 'earn', what, n, side: 'galaxy' } for a kill that pays, the war
// front's points and wins as well: universe/economy.js's EARN keys).
